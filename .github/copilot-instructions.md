## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to                                                               | Do this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file                                  | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in your AI coding assistant). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session.                                                        |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file                         | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine                         | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Decide where a given gate belongs                                         | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer.                                                                                                                              |
| Use the same hook across tools                                            | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below.                                                                                                             |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in your AI coding assistant via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer                  | Catches                                                                                                                           | Timing |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work.                       | ms–s   |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s      |
| Pre-push               | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set).                                                       | s–min  |
| CI                     | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally.                                        | min    |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and at which layer; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Your AI coding assistant, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool                     | Events | Handlers                               | Context injection | Config                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Your AI coding assistant | ~30    | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes               | `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` |
| Cursor                   | ~18    | command, prompt                        | yes               | `.cursor/hooks.json`                                  |
| Codex                    | 10     | command                                | yes               | `.codex/hooks.json`                                   |
| Windsurf                 | 12     | command                                | **no**            | `.windsurf/hooks.json`                                |
| Copilot                  | ~13    | command, http, prompt                  | yes (VS Code)     | `.github/hooks/*.json`                                |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only _run_ the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` project, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.

## M3L3 Implementation: Per-Edit Hooks (This Project)

Two per-edit hooks have been configured in `.github/hooks/`:

### 1. **Lint Hook** (`lint-hook.json`)

- **Trigger**: Agent edits any `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` file
- **Action**: Runs `npm run lint --fix` to auto-correct ESLint violations
- **Exit**: 0 (success), or 2 (error blocks with feedback to agent)
- **Latency**: ~100ms per file

### 2. **Typecheck Hook** (`typecheck-hook.json`)

- **Trigger**: Agent edits any `.ts`, `.tsx` file
- **Action**: Runs `npx tsc --noEmit` on the single file
- **Exit**: 0 (success), or 2 (error blocks with feedback to agent)
- **Latency**: ~200ms per file on warm cache

### How to Test

After agent edits a file, check the hook output in Copilot's hook logs (VS Code command palette → "GitHub Copilot: Show Logs"). Both hooks should complete within 1-2s.

### Next Steps

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Configure `lefthook.yml` for staged file checks (linter + full typecheck on commit)
- **Pre-push hooks**: Broader test suite before pushing to remote
- **Risk areas**: Define scoped tests in `context/foundation/test-plan.md`
